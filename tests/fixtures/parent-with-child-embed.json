Within each pair, the stimuli can be rotated around an axis 360 degrees, thus, rotation is not considered a difference. Changing shape, size, and specularity is considered a difference.\n\nOverall, participants face 40 tasks, divided into 4 rounds of 10 trials each.\n\nParticipants are given an initial endowment, and for each mistake they get a penalty $p$. The final payment is given by the initial endowment minus the sum of penalties.\n",
                                "q10.question": "The experiment will be conducted online on the Prolific platform.\n\n1) After accepting the participant consent form, in the first part of the study, participants have to answer a short survey regarding their attitude towards AI and information technology (eight questions). Prior to the second part Participants will also take an attentiveness test.\n\n2) The second part consists of the core experiment task - a mental comparison task.\n\n3) Finally, the third part includes the “post-believes” survey (repetition of the first survey) and collecting demographic information.\n\n4) To be eligible, Participants should be fluent in English and be connected with a Desktop computer. We do not discriminate against participants on any other grounds. Participants are also asked to answer a few attention and comprehension questions.\n",

This will serve as control about learning in the task. This way we can disentangle the impact of pure learning from that of AI assistance.",
                                "q15.question": "The main units of observation are:\n\nPerformance (discrete data): number of correct answers given\nAI adoption (frequency data): frequency of reliance on AI suggestion\nReaction time (continuous data): time that participants spend in the task\n\n\nThese units of observations are compared across controlled manipulations (treatments)\n\nBetween-subject: \nparticipants will be assigned randomly to an Accuracy (A) performance goal or Speed (S) performance goal groups.\n\nWithin-subject:  \nHigh Penalty (HP) and Low Penalty (LP) decision making, which implies a higher and a lower penalty for each incorrect answer, respectively.\nFurthermore, we will control for the impact of pure learning in the task with control sessions that mimic experimental treatments, but without AI.\n",
                                "q17.question": "The analysis will provide a visual description of data (graphs) complemented by non-parametric tests about distributions and central tendencies across treatments.\n\nThe non-parametric analysis will also be corroborated by a mixed Model regression analysis controlling for fixed and random components. Effects will be assessed against the control sessions.\n\nWe will also test pre/post self-reported beliefs in the survey."
